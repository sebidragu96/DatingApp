This web application demonstrates the workflow of an ASPNET Core API (.NET 5) and an Angular 12 solution. I have followed in this process the Udemy course Build an app with 
aspnet core and angular from scratch. Since I already have more than 2 years professional experience in .NET and I know the basics of Angular 2+ (see the other repository: 
proconsebi-netlify), I felt that my desire for knowledge can be accomplished (at least for a few months) with a full-stack project.
